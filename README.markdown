# Demo Cloudera Apache Hadoop environment in vagrant with Puppet

This is a simple sandbox environment using the Puppet Labs approved module [razorsedge/cloudera](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/razorsedge/cloudera)

Note that currently this only creates a single VM with the CM server on it. Additional cluster nodes are not added yet.

## Usage

```
vagrant up
```
